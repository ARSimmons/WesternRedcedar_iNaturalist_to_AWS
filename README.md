Script exports Western Redcedar observations from the iNaturalist API into an AWS-RDS Postgres database.

Data is converted to a point(geom) type and can be visualized in the QGIS platform.

All the data is being taken from an API call of 'Western Redcedar Dieback Map' project entries being captured and saved in 'iNaturalist'.

Instructions on how to add community science data to the 'Western Redcedar Dieback Map' project via the free app 'iNaturalist' can be found here.
